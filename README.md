## Environment Variables

We provide a file named `.env.example` with placeholder environment variables. To configure your local environment:

1. **Create a `.env` File**  
   Copy `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` in the **Backend** folder (and in the **Frontend** folder if applicable):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. **Update Values**  
   Open `.env` and replace the placeholder values with the correct information for your local environment (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
3. **Do Not Commit `.env`**  
   Your `.env` file should be ignored by Git to keep sensitive data private. Make sure to avoid committing any real credentials to the repository.

### Sharing Keys with Collaborators

We will share the required keys securely in a private Discord channel for collaborators.
